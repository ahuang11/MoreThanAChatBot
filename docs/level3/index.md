# Level 3: End-to-End AI Development for Conservation Science

Here, we will use an example of structured data extraction to illustrate integrating LLMs into a custom end-to-end pipeline. In ecological research, extracting specific data from scientific papers can be time-consuming. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) can streamline this process. This guide demonstrates how to use the `ellmer` package in R to extract species population trends from a PDF document. While it is possible to complete this task using a browser-based chatbot, including the LLM in your code with your prompt makes your work more reproducible.
