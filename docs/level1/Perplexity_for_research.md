# Perplexity

**Online Service**: [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)  

- Specializes in online search, in other words, accesses and analyzes real-time information from the internet
- It provides up-to-date scientific data, recent discoveries, and current research 
- It is a better tool for fact-checking as it cites its sources directly

**What can earth scientists use this for?**
Here are just a few examples of how Earth scientists can use Perplexity AI to enhance their research and data analysis:

**1. How do I apply anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual climate patterns?**

If you’re working on identifying unusual climate patterns, Perplexity can help guide you through the various anomaly detection techniques.
