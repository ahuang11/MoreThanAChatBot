## What is ChatGPT?

You might remember the day back in Novemeber 2022 when our data world, as we knew it, changed. News headlines appeared announcing the launch of ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI.

### This is what the interface looks like:

### To use CHatGPT, create an account, and let's dive into some conservation examples!


## What prompts should I use?

As a "Generative Pre-Trained Transformer" (the GPT part of ChatGPT), the more specific your prompt, the better.

For example, the ***New York Times*** wrote about an example where ChatGPT outperformed doctors at diagnosing illness because ChatGPT used entire patient histories. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/health/chatgpt-ai-doctors-diagnosis.html

Like in medicine, what if you want to use ecological data to make an important conservation decision?

This introduces the importance of how you use prompts in large language models.

## Environmental Example: Extracting Water Rights form 100s of pdfs

Imagine you need to create a data set on water quality rights. But alas, all of the information you need are in scanned pages of long pdfs. How do you quickly extract this information without it taking all day (or week) while manually entering it into Excel? Let's use ChatGPT to help us.
