### To use CHatGPT, create an account, and let's dive into some conservation examples!


## What prompts should I use?

As a "Generative Pre-Trained Transformer" (the GPT part of ChatGPT), the more specific your prompt, the better.

For example, the ***New York Times*** wrote about an example where ChatGPT outperformed doctors at diagnosing illness because ChatGPT used entire patient histories.

Like in medicine, what if you want to use ecological data to make an important conservation decision? This introduces the importance of how you use prompts in large language models.

## Example: Extracting Water Rights form 100s of pdfs

Imagine you need to create a data set on water quality. But alas, all of the information you need are in scanned pages of in long pdfs. How do you get these numbers? Preferably without taking all day manually entering the inforamtion you need into Excel? Let's use ChatGPT to help us.
