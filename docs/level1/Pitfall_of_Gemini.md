# Should We Blindly Trust Google’s Overview? The Short Answer is No.

With the rapid development of AI tools like Google’s Overview and other advanced search engines, it’s tempting to take information at face value. After all, these tools are designed to quickly pull together data and summarize it for us. But should we _blindly_ trust these AI-generated overviews without any fact-checking? The short answer is **no**.

It’s easy to assume that AI tools, which aggregate vast amounts of data, are always right. However, even these sophisticated tools can be flawed. AI relies on patterns and data that might be outdated, biased, or misinterpreted. Simply trusting these overviews without questioning the sources or content can lead to misleading conclusions or errors.

Take the following example:

The image above was pulled from Google’s overview, but as you can see, it’s factually incorrect. While AI tools are designed to present information quickly, they don’t always ensure that it is accurate. This can be problematic, especially in fields like science, research, and environmental studies, where precision is crucial.

So, what can we do about it? The answer is simple: **fact-check**.

Fact-checking is more important than ever when using AI tools. One way to do this is by looking for tools that cite their sources. Tools like Perplexity AI are a great choice in situations like this because they provide references for the information they present. This allows users to verify the accuracy of the data and track down the original sources.

By cross-referencing information from reliable sources, you can catch any inaccuracies or discrepancies and ensure you’re making decisions based on credible, well-sourced data.

Perplexity is an excellent example of an AI tool that prioritizes transparency. It gives you the ability to trace information back to its origin. This is especially important when working with complex datasets, or research findings. By providing citations, Perplexity allows users to validate the AI’s output rather than simply accepting it.

**Conclusion:** Proceed with Caution

AI tools are undeniably powerful, but that doesn't mean we should rely on them without question. While they offer valuable insights and convenience, it’s essential to remain critical and verify the information they provide. Ultimately, taking the extra step to fact-check ensures that we don’t fall victim to the dangers of blindly trusting AI-generated overviews.
