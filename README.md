# More Than a ChatBot

## Overview

Many conservation scientists primarily engage with large language models (LLMs) through simple chat interactions, limiting their ability to leverage these tools for coding and data analysis. This project seeks to bridge that gap by documenting real-world applications of LLMs for scientific workflows.
