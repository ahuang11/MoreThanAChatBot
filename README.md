Many environmental data scientists primarily engage with large language models (LLMs) through simple prompting and chat interactions with popular artificial intelligence (AI) providers like OpenAI ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. However, there are additional untapped applications for LLMs in environmental data science that can enhance capacity and improve data pipelines.

The unfamiliarity with LLMs within environmental data science limits scientists' ability to leverage these tools for coding and data analysis. This project seeks to bridge that knowledge gap and open the black box of LLM application in environmental science by providing resources and real-world use cases of LLMs in scientific workflows... and show that LLMs can be _more than a chatbot_ ðŸ¤–

## Table of Contents

We know that every person has a different level of experience with AI, data analysis, and coding, so we have targeted resources for three broad groups based on your experience.  Use this definition to determine your level:

- [Level 1](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level1/overview):  An expert in your field, but little or no experience using AI tools and writing code
- [Level 2](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level2/overview): You have dabbled in coding and feel comfortable in at least one language.  You may have also tested the web-interface of some large language models, and want to learn more. You know that IDE stands for integrated development environment for coding and you want to know how to enhance your IDE with AI
- [Level 3](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level3/overview):  You use coding to enhance your workflows already, and you want to learn how to incorporate AI models into your code.
