## Overview

Many environmental data scientists primarily engage with large language models (LLMs) through simple prompting and chat interactions with popular artificial intelligence (AI) providers like OpenAI ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. However, there are additional untapped applications for LLMs in environmental data science that can enhance capacity and improve data pipelines.

The unfamiliarity with LLMs within environmental data science limits scientists' ability to leverage these tools for coding and data analysis. This project seeks to bridge that knowledge gap and open the black box of LLM application in environmental science by providing resources and real-world use cases of LLMs in scientific workflows... and show that LLMs can be _more than a chatbot_ ðŸ¤–

## Table of Contents

We know that every person has a different level of experience with AI, data analysis, and coding, so we have targeted resources for three broad groups based on your experience.  Use this definition to determine your level:

- [Level 1](#level-1-ai-powered-web-tools-for-researchers):  An expert in your field, but little or no experience using AI tools and writing code
- [Level 2](#level-2-ai-assisted-coding-with-intelligent-ides): You have dabbled in coding and feel comfortable in at least one language.  You may have also tested the web-interface of some large language models, and want to learn more. You know that IDE stands for integrated development environment for coding and you want to know how to enhance your IDE with AI
- [Level 3](#level-3-end-to-end-ai-development-for-conservation-science):  You use coding to enhance your workflows already, and you want to learn how to incorporate AI models into your code. 

---

### **[Level 1](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level1/providers/): AI-Powered Web Tools for Researchers**  
Discover how LLM providers like ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek can streamline conservation research. Explore practical applications such as structured data extraction, document analysis, and exploratory researchâ€”no coding required. Learn how to integrate these tools into your workflow using browser-based solutions like Google Colab.  

### **[Level 2](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level2/index): AI-Assisted Coding with Intelligent IDEs**  
Take your AI-powered research further with IDEs like Cursor. These tools enhance coding efficiency through automated code generation, debugging, and workflow optimization. Learn how to integrate AI into your development environment to refine data analysis, modeling, and automation processes.  

### **[Level 3](https://ahuang11.github.io/MoreThanAChatBot/level3/index): End-to-End AI Development for Conservation Science**  
For those building AI solutions, this level covers the use of Python and R toolkits, hosting platforms like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), and advanced workflows for conservation data processing, machine learning, and automation. Get hands-on with example code, deployment guides, and best practices for developing AI-driven scientific applications.
